        <h1>Psychology Class Notes</h1>
        <p>
            We made a jump from chapter one to chapter thirteen.
            Chapter thirteen was all about social <br>psychology. This 
            pretty much covers the behavior of individuals or groups 
            of people. This <br>chapter goes over how the individual 
            acts when observed versus when alone. Also, what <br>causes 
            different types of behavior. How behavior is explained. 
            How we view the causes of <br>an indivuals or groups behavior.
            I'm only taking a few slides and condensing them here.
