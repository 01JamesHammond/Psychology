            We made a jump from chapter one to chapter thirteen.
            Chapter thirteen was all about social psychology. This 
            pretty much covers the behavior of individuals or groups 
            of people. This chapter goes over how the individual 
            acts when observed versus when alone. Also, what causes 
            different types of behavior. How behavior is explained. 
            How we view the causes of an indivuals or groups behavior.
            I'm only taking a few slides and condensing them here.
